# Create a Recipe Page

Think of something you like to cook and/or eat.  You will write your **own original recipe** in an HTML page. The recipe cannot be copied.  You can modify an existing recipe. Below is the list of requirements for your page.

* **An image of the recipe.** Use Wikipedia to find your images as they are free to use.  Download the image and upload it into the replit file.
* **A title:** An ```<h1>``` element with the title of your recipe
* Under the title an ```<h2>``` element with **your name** "By..."
* A ```<p>``` element containing a paragraph explaining the historical or cultural origins of your recipe (you will have to look this up on your own)
* A second ```<p>``` element containing a paragraph explaining your personal connection to the recipe. For example: why you like the recipe, where or how you learned the recipe, or any other anecdote about the significance of the recipe.
* An **unordered list** of the ingredients.  Include a title **"Ingredients"**
* An **ordered list** of the steps. Include the title **"Instructions"**
*   * Add **TWO HYPERLINKS** to a recipe, website or article about foods that go well with your recipe.
